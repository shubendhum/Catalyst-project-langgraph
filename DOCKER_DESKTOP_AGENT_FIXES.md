# Docker Desktop Agent Task Pickup - Fixes Applied

## Date: Current Session

## Problem Statement
Agents were not picking up tasks in Docker Desktop environment despite multiple previous fixes for environment detection, blocking consumer issues, and frontend UI enhancements.

---

## Root Cause Identified

**The RabbitMQ infrastructure was never being initialized.**

The `rabbitmq-init.sh` script was mounted to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sh` in docker-compose, but this is a **PostgreSQL/MongoDB convention** that RabbitMQ does NOT support. The script never executed, meaning:
- ❌ Exchange `catalyst.events` was never created
- ❌ Agent queues (planner-queue, architect-queue, etc.) were never created
- ❌ Routing key bindings were never established
- ❌ Agents couldn't consume messages (queues didn't exist)

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Created RabbitMQ Infrastructure Initialization

**File:** `/app/backend/init_rabbitmq.py` (NEW)

**What it does:**
- Connects to RabbitMQ with exponential backoff retry (up to 10 attempts)
- Creates the `catalyst.events` topic exchange
- Creates 8 agent queues with proper configuration:
  - planner-queue → `catalyst.task.initiated`
  - architect-queue → `catalyst.plan.created`
  - coder-queue → `catalyst.architecture.proposed`
  - tester-queue → `catalyst.code.pr.opened`
  - reviewer-queue → `catalyst.test.results`
  - deployer-queue → `catalyst.review.decision`
  - explorer-queue → `catalyst.explorer.scan.request`
  - orchestrator-queue → `catalyst.*.complete`
- Creates failed-events dead letter queue
- Binds all queues to exchange with correct routing keys
- Logs detailed progress for troubleshooting

**Queue Configuration:**
```python
arguments={
    'x-message-ttl': 3600000,  # 1 hour TTL
    'x-max-length': 10000       # Max 10k messages
}
```

### 2. ✅ Updated Backend Startup Sequence

**File:** `/app/backend/server.py` (MODIFIED)

**Changes:**
- Added RabbitMQ infrastructure initialization BEFORE starting agent workers
- Ensures exchanges, queues, and bindings exist before agents try to connect
- Logs clear success/failure messages for troubleshooting

**New startup flow:**
1. Log environment detection
2. **Initialize RabbitMQ infrastructure** (NEW)
3. Start agent workers
4. Start background scheduler

**Code added:**
```python
# CRITICAL: Initialize RabbitMQ infrastructure FIRST
from init_rabbitmq import init_rabbitmq
rabbitmq_url = os.getenv("RABBITMQ_URL")
if rabbitmq_url:
    logger.info("🐰 Initializing RabbitMQ infrastructure...")
    success = init_rabbitmq(rabbitmq_url)
    if not success:
        logger.error("❌ RabbitMQ initialization failed!")
    else:
        logger.info("✅ RabbitMQ infrastructure ready")
```

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed RabbitMQ Startup Timing

**File:** `/app/docker-compose.artifactory.yml` (MODIFIED)

**Change:**
```yaml
# Before:
rabbitmq:
  condition: service_started

# After:
rabbitmq:
  condition: service_healthy  # Wait for healthcheck to pass
```

**Why:** Backend was starting before RabbitMQ was fully ready to accept connections, causing agent initialization failures.

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed Postgres Event Logging

**File:** `/app/backend/events/publisher.py` (MODIFIED)

**Problem:** Postgres event audit logging was blocking and could fail, breaking event publishing.

**Solution:** Made it fire-and-forget:
```python
# Try to save to Postgres for audit (best effort, don't block)
try:
    if get_config()["databases"]["postgres"]["enabled"]:
        # Fire-and-forget: create task but don't await
        asyncio.create_task(self._save_to_postgres(event))
except Exception as pg_error:
    # Log but don't fail the publish operation
    logger.debug(f"Postgres event audit skipped: {pg_error}")
```

**Benefit:** Event publishing never fails due to Postgres issues.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### On Backend Startup:
```
🚀 Catalyst Backend Starting...
📍 Environment: docker_desktop
🎯 Orchestration Mode: event_driven
🐳 Docker Desktop detected - initializing event-driven mode...
🐰 Initializing RabbitMQ infrastructure (exchanges, queues, bindings)...
Attempting RabbitMQ connection (attempt 1/10)...
✅ Created/verified exchange: catalyst.events (topic)
✅ Created queue: planner-queue → catalyst.task.initiated
✅ Created queue: architect-queue → catalyst.plan.created
✅ Created queue: coder-queue → catalyst.architecture.proposed
✅ Created queue: tester-queue → catalyst.code.pr.opened
✅ Created queue: reviewer-queue → catalyst.test.results
✅ Created queue: deployer-queue → catalyst.review.decision
✅ Created queue: explorer-queue → catalyst.explorer.scan.request
✅ Created queue: orchestrator-queue → catalyst.*.complete
✅ Created dead letter queue: failed-events
✅ RabbitMQ infrastructure initialized successfully!
   📊 Created: 1 exchange, 8 agent queues, 1 DLQ
✅ RabbitMQ infrastructure ready
🚀 Starting agent workers...
✅ Started planner worker
✅ Started architect worker
✅ Started coder worker
✅ Started tester worker
✅ Started reviewer worker
✅ Started deployer worker
🎧 6 agent workers listening to event queues
✅ Agent workers started in background
✅ Background scheduler started
```

### When Task is Submitted:
```
▶️ Executing task abc-123 in EVENT-DRIVEN mode
📤 Published event: catalyst.task.initiated (trace: xyz-789)
🎯 planner processing event: task.initiated (trace: xyz-789)
🤖 planner: Starting processing...
✅ planner completed. Published: catalyst.plan.created
📤 Published event: catalyst.plan.created (trace: xyz-789)
🎯 architect processing event: plan.created (trace: xyz-789)
...
```

## Verification Commands

### 1. Check RabbitMQ Infrastructure
```bash
# SSH into RabbitMQ container
docker exec -it catalyst-rabbitmq bash

# List exchanges (should see catalyst.events)
rabbitmqctl list_exchanges

# List queues (should see 8 agent queues + 1 DLQ)
rabbitmqctl list_queues

# List bindings (should see routing key mappings)
rabbitmqctl list_bindings
```

### 2. Check Backend Logs
```bash
# View startup logs
docker logs catalyst-backend | grep "RabbitMQ"

# Should see:
# ✅ RabbitMQ infrastructure initialized successfully
# ✅ Started planner worker
# ✅ Started architect worker
# etc.

# Watch for agent activity
docker logs -f catalyst-backend | grep "🎯"

# Should see agents processing events when tasks are submitted
```

### 3. Test Task Submission
```bash
# Submit a test task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Build a simple hello world app", "conversation_id": "test-123"}'

# Monitor logs for agent processing
docker logs -f catalyst-backend

# Should see event chain:
# 📤 Published event: catalyst.task.initiated
# 🎯 planner processing event
# 📤 Published event: catalyst.plan.created
# 🎯 architect processing event
# etc.
```

### 4. Check RabbitMQ Management UI
```
Open browser: http://localhost:15672
Login: catalyst / catalyst_queue_2025

Navigate to:
- Exchanges → should see "catalyst.events"
- Queues → should see 9 queues
- Each queue → Click → Bindings → should see routing key
```
