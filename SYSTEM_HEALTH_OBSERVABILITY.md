# System Health Check and Observability Enhancements

## Overview
Comprehensive health monitoring and clear startup logging for all interdependent Catalyst services.

---

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. ✅ Centralized Health Check System

**New Module:** `/app/backend/observability/health_check.py`

**Features:**
- Single source of truth for all service health status
- Individual health checks for each service:
  - MongoDB (required)
  - PostgreSQL (optional)
  - Redis (optional with fallback)
  - Qdrant (optional with fallback)
  - RabbitMQ (Docker Desktop only)
- Detailed service information (version, size, connections, etc.)
- Overall system health aggregation
- Clear status enum: `HEALTHY`, `DEGRADED`, `UNHEALTHY`, `UNKNOWN`

**Service Status Definitions:**
- **HEALTHY**: Service is running and responsive
- **DEGRADED**: Service unavailable but has fallback (Redis/Qdrant)
- **UNHEALTHY**: Critical service failed (MongoDB)
- **UNKNOWN**: Unable to determine status

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Startup Sequence

**Updated:** `/app/backend/server.py`

**Before (Unclear):**
```
INFO: Started server process [123]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
```

**After (Clear & Detailed):**
```

### 3. ✅ Health Check API Endpoint

**New Endpoint:** `GET /api/health`

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T12:34:56.789Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 125.45,
  "overall_status": "healthy",
  "message": "All services healthy",
  "services": {
    "mongodb": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Connected and responsive",
      "version": "5.0.27",
      "details": {
        "max_bson_size": 16777216,
        "max_message_size": 48000000
      }
    },
    "redis": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Connected and responsive",
      "version": "7.0.12",
      "details": {
        "used_memory": "2.5M",
        "connected_clients": 5,
        "uptime_seconds": 3600
      }
    },
    "qdrant": {
      "status": "degraded",
      "message": "Not available, using in-memory vector storage fallback",
      "fallback": "in-memory"
    },
    "rabbitmq": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Connected and responsive",
      "details": {
        "queues": {
          "planner-queue": {
            "messages": 0,
            "consumers": 1
          },
          "architect-queue": {
            "messages": 0,
            "consumers": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Monitoring dashboards
- Kubernetes/Docker health probes
- CI/CD health verification
- Debugging startup issues
- Load balancer health checks

### 4. ✅ Improved Docker Compose Health Checks

**Updated:** `/app/docker-compose.artifactory.yml`

**Changes:**
```yaml
backend:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8001/api/health"]  # Changed from /api/
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 90s  # Increased from 60s to allow RabbitMQ init
```

**Benefits:**
- Uses comprehensive health endpoint
- Checks all dependencies before marking healthy
- Allows time for RabbitMQ infrastructure initialization
- Prevents premature "healthy" status

---

## Service-Specific Health Checks

### MongoDB (Required)
**What's Checked:**
- Connection via ping command
- Server version
- Max BSON object size
- Max message size

**Failure Impact:** UNHEALTHY (critical)

---

### PostgreSQL (Optional)
**What's Checked:**
- Connection via asyncpg
- Database version
- Database size (human-readable)

**Failure Impact:** DEGRADED (not required in K8s)

**Notes:**
- Only checked in Docker Desktop mode
- Not available in Kubernetes environment

---

### Redis (Optional with Fallback)
**What's Checked:**
- Connection via redis.asyncio
- Ping response
- Redis version
- Memory usage
- Connected clients
- Uptime

**Failure Impact:** DEGRADED (falls back to in-memory cache)

**Fallback Behavior:**
- Cost optimizer uses in-memory cache
- No data persistence between restarts
- Fully functional, just no distribution

---

### Qdrant (Optional with Fallback)
**What's Checked:**
- Connection via qdrant-client
- Collections count
- Collection names

**Failure Impact:** DEGRADED (falls back to in-memory vector storage)

**Fallback Behavior:**
- Learning service uses numpy-based search
- No persistence between restarts
- Fully functional, just slower for large datasets

---

### RabbitMQ (Docker Desktop Only)
**What's Checked:**
- Connection via pika
- Queue existence and stats
- Message counts per queue
- Consumer counts per queue

**Failure Impact:** DEGRADED/UNHEALTHY

**Notes:**
- Only checked in Docker Desktop event-driven mode
- Not checked in Kubernetes (sequential mode)
- Critical for agent task distribution

---

## Startup Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: MongoDB Unavailable
```
❌ MONGODB: UNHEALTHY - Connection failed: Cannot assign requested address
Overall Status: UNHEALTHY
```
**Action:** Backend won't start properly, fix MongoDB connection

---

### Scenario 2: RabbitMQ Unavailable (Docker Desktop)
```
⚠️ RABBITMQ: DEGRADED - Not available
⚠️ RabbitMQ unhealthy - skipping infrastructure initialization
   Event-driven mode will not function properly!
```
**Action:** Agents won't pick up tasks, RabbitMQ needs to be fixed

---

### Scenario 3: Redis/Qdrant Unavailable
```
⚠️ REDIS: DEGRADED - Not available, using in-memory cache fallback
   └─ Fallback: in-memory
⚠️ QDRANT: DEGRADED - Not available, using in-memory vector storage fallback
   └─ Fallback: in-memory
Overall Status: DEGRADED
```
**Action:** System continues with fallbacks, acceptable for development

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Check System Health via API
```bash
# From host
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq

# From inside container
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq .overall_status
```

### Watch Startup Logs
```bash
# See full startup sequence
docker logs catalyst-backend 2>&1 | grep -A 100 "CATALYST BACKEND STARTING"

# See only health status
docker logs catalyst-backend 2>&1 | grep "SYSTEM HEALTH STATUS" -A 20

# See RabbitMQ init
docker logs catalyst-backend 2>&1 | grep "RabbitMQ"
```

### Check Docker Compose Health
```bash
# See service health status
docker-compose ps

# Should show:
# catalyst-backend   ... Up (healthy)
```

### Monitor Continuous Health
```bash
# Poll health endpoint every 5 seconds
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq .overall_status'
```

---

## Integration with External Monitoring

### Prometheus
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'catalyst'
    metrics_path: '/api/health'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['catalyst-backend:8001']
```

### Kubernetes Liveness/Readiness Probes
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/health
    port: 8001
  initialDelaySeconds: 90
  periodSeconds: 30

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/health
    port: 8001
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### Grafana Dashboard Query
```sql
SELECT 
  timestamp,
  overall_status,
  services.mongodb.status as mongo,
  services.rabbitmq.status as rabbitmq
FROM health_checks
WHERE timestamp > now() - interval '1 hour'
```

## Testing

### Test Health Endpoint
```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Check overall status only
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq .overall_status

# Check specific service
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq .services.mongodb

# Pretty print full health
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq
```

### Test Startup Sequence
```bash
# Restart backend and watch logs
docker restart catalyst-backend
docker logs -f catalyst-backend

# Should see clear startup sequence with health checks
```

### Test Service Failure Handling
```bash
# Stop Redis
docker stop catalyst-redis

# Check health (should show degraded with fallback)
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health | jq .services.redis

# Should show: "status": "degraded", "fallback": "in-memory"

# Restart Redis
docker start catalyst-redis

# Check health again (should show healthy)
```
