## Installation Instructions

### Backend Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/username/new-project.git
   cd new-project/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and populate it with:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

Here are the required environment variables for the backend:

- `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run (default is 5000).
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens.

## Running the App

1. Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are structured as follows:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
