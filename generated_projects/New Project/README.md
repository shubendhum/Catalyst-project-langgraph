## Installation Instructions

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-project.git
   cd new-project/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the following variables (see the Environment Variables section for details).

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend

1. Change to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

For proper configuration, the following environment variables should be set in the `.env` file located in the `backend` directory:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/new-project
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Make sure to replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/new-project` with your actual MongoDB URI and `your_jwt_secret` with a securely generated JWT secret key.

## Running the App

After setting up the backend and frontend as per the instructions above:

1. Start the backend server (if it’s not running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend application (if it’s not running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be found at `/docs` once the backend server is running. In general, the API supports the following main endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in a user
- `GET /api/users`: Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/user/:id`: Get user details
- `PUT /api/user/:id`: Update user details
- `DELETE /api/user/:id`: Delete a user

### Example Request

Here’s an example of a request to register a new user:

```bash
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "username": "newuser",
  "password": "password123",
}
```
