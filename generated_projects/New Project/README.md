## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Node.js (version X.X or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Database server (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

### Backend Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/new-project.git
    cd new-project/backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your database:
   - Create a new database (e.g., in MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
   - Configure your database settings in `.env` file.

### Frontend Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the frontend to connect to your backend API by editing the environment files.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following keys:
```
DATABASE_URL=<YourDatabaseURL>
JWT_SECRET=<YourJWTSecret>
PORT=5000
```
And a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=<YourBackendAPIURL>
```

## Running the App

### Running the Backend
1. Make sure your database server is running.
2. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
3. The backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend
1. Start the frontend server:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```
2. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Documentation
The API is RESTful and designed to handle the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve all resources.
- `GET /api/resource/:id`: Retrieve a resource by ID.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update a resource by ID.
