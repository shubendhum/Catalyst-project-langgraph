Concurrently, the engineer integrated Organization Azure OpenAI, addressing numerous configuration errors: incorrect subscription key headers, model/deployment parameter discrepancies, and critical  and  exceptions in , , and . A major shift occurred with the implementation of the Device Code Flow for Azure OAuth2 and a multi-chat UI with conversation persistence, aiming to align Catalyst's UX with Emergent's. The persistent HuggingFace SSL errors were tackled by applying comprehensive Python-level SSL disabling and environment variable configurations. The last reported error concerns an unspecified issue, with the user providing a screenshot for diagnosis, suggesting a recurring or new problem after the latest fixes.

<product_requirements>
The Catalyst platform is a multi-agent AI system for full-stack application development (React/FastAPI/MongoDB), featuring a conversational UI and LLM integrations (Claude, AWS Bedrock, Emergent LLM Key). Key user requests included enhancing chat interface responsiveness, real-time agent feedback, and migrating to an enterprise event-driven architecture with dual Kubernetes/Docker Desktop support. Specific LLM enhancements focused on Organization Azure OpenAI with OAuth2 authentication.

Currently, the application has successfully implemented:
-   Initial Docker build fixes for frontend and backend services on local Docker Desktop.
-   Unified Docker Compose and Makefile for local and artifactory builds.
-   Organization Azure OpenAI integration, including:
    -   OAuth2 Device Code Flow for authentication.
    -   Correct handling of  and  headers.
    -   Disabling SSL verification for corporate proxy environments.
    -   Persistent LLM configuration storage in the database.
    -   Correct  and removal of  parameter for Azure OpenAI API calls.
-   Multi-chat windows with context preservation and auto-titling for conversations, aligning with Emergent chat UX.
-   Comprehensive SSL disabling for HuggingFace model downloads, critical for corporate proxy environments.
-   Fixes for various backend runtime errors (,  issues, Postgres JSON serialization) related to LLM config, OAuth, and agent orchestration.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently debugging a persistent SSL verification failure for HuggingFace model downloads, specifically when the user runs the application on their local Docker Desktop within a corporate proxy environment. While the backend logs in the Kubernetes environment (where the AI operates) showed the SSL issue as resolved, the user reported it was still occurring locally. This led the AI to understand the critical context of the user's corporate proxy.

After this, the user reported a new error via a screenshot: an unspecified error that occurred while starting the device code flow. This suggests a new or recurring problem with the Azure OAuth2 Device Code Flow functionality. The AI has just received this error report and has not yet started to diagnose it, but understands it's related to the Device Code Flow or its interaction with the environment.
