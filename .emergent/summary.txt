The AI engineer primarily focused on stabilizing the Catalyst platform on Docker Desktop, addressing persistent build, runtime, and integration issues. Initial efforts resolved  import errors and attempted to mitigate HuggingFace SSL issues through dependency versioning. A major pivot occurred to integrate OpenAI Embeddings, eliminating HuggingFace dependencies altogether, and fixing  build issues. Concurrently, significant time was spent debugging Docker Desktop-specific problems, including backend container unhealthiness, port binding, and a critical blocking  consumer call that prevented Uvicorn from starting. Environment detection logic for Docker Desktop versus Kubernetes was also a recurring challenge, leading to agents not picking up tasks. Frontend UI enhancements for detailed LLM thinking and file operations were also implemented and subsequently debugged for CSS syntax and backend event loop errors. The current state involves a comprehensive code architecture review to understand why agents aren't processing tasks on Docker Desktop.

The Catalyst platform is a multi-agent AI system for full-stack application development, offering a conversational UI and LLM integrations. The user sought to enhance chat interface responsiveness, real-time agent feedback, and migrate to an enterprise event-driven architecture compatible with both Kubernetes and local Docker Desktop. Key LLM-related requests included Organization Azure OpenAI with OAuth2, and later, the integration of OpenAI Embeddings for improved learning quality. UI enhancements for displaying detailed LLM thought processes and file operations were explicitly requested, aiming for an Emergent chat-like experience. The primary challenge throughout the development has been ensuring robust functionality and correct environment detection on local Docker Desktop, tackling SSL issues, dependency conflicts, and backend service startup problems.

-   : Initially updated for  version management and HuggingFace model pre-download caching. Later, it was cleaned up to remove HuggingFace-related build steps, pip upgrade moved to earlier, and set .
-   : Fixed  by importing  from .
-   : Added  and  for HuggingFace SSL disabling (later largely moot with HuggingFace removal).
-   : Ensured global SSL disabling for Python's  module, handles environment variable loading, and orchestrator startup logic. Modified  event to manage agent workers.
-   : Significantly refactored to remove  (HuggingFace) dependency and integrate  for OpenAI Embeddings.  now uses .
-   : Managed Python dependencies, particularly versions of , , , and .  was removed.
-   : Version constraint for  was removed.
-   : Modified  to run  in a thread pool to prevent blocking the asyncio event loop.
-   : Fixed event loop errors by wrapping  in  and ensuring a running event loop is available.
-   : Updated  logic to correctly identify Docker Desktop environment using  environment variable, preventing incorrect sequential mode detection.
-   : Enhanced to integrate new  and , updated WebSocket message handling for real-time detailed LLM feedback, and added message metadata management.
-    (NEW): Contains UI elements for the enhanced chat.
-    (NEW): Provides dark theme styling for chat components, fixed  syntax.
-    (NEW): Renders detailed LLM messages, including thoughts, file operations, and progress.
-    (NEW): Provides dark theme styling for message rendering, fixed  syntax.
-   : Updated for Langfuse v3+ with  service and related environment variables (). Added  to backend service.
-    (NEW): Created to override settings for local Docker Desktop, including port mapping and health check adjustments.
-   Docker is not installed! Please install Docker Desktop.: Removed  for  from local build commands.

<pending_tasks>
-   Address remaining sync/async issues in file I/O operations in agent files (e.g., , ).
-   Complete the full migration to the enterprise event-driven architecture (Phase 4+).
-   Further enhance the Explorer agent (Phase 5).
-   Re-implement streaming for Azure OpenAI API calls once the exact streaming format is known.
-   Implement additional Emergent chat features (e.g., Rollback, File Attachments, Chat Forking).

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently troubleshooting issues on the user's local Docker Desktop environment where agents were not picking up and processing tasks, despite backend services appearing to run. This involved a series of diagnostics to identify underlying problems:
1.  **Blocking RabbitMQ Consumer:** A critical issue was identified where  was synchronously blocking the asyncio event loop within  calls in , preventing Uvicorn from binding to its port and handling HTTP requests. This was fixed by running the blocking call in a thread pool ().
2.  **Incorrect Environment Detection:** The backend was incorrectly defaulting to sequential mode (Kubernetes detection) instead of event-driven mode on Docker Desktop. This was traced to a flawed  logic in  and rectified by explicitly setting  in .
3.  **Frontend UI Enhancements & Fixes:** An enhanced chat UI (similar to Emergent chat) was implemented with detailed LLM thinking display, file operation links, and real-time updates using new  and . Subsequent errors included:
    *   Backend  in , fixed by .
    *   CSS syntax errors (, ) in  and  were fixed.
4.  **Langfuse Configuration:** An error regarding  for Langfuse v3+ was resolved by adding a  service and configuration to .

Despite these fixes, the user reported that agents are still not picking up tasks. The AI engineer is currently performing a comprehensive code architecture review specifically for the Docker Desktop environment to diagnose this persistent issue, focusing on the agent's ability to pick up and work on tasks.
