The trajectory outlines a comprehensive evolution of the Catalyst platform, initially focusing on enhancing existing functionality and then transitioning to a significant architectural migration. The AI engineer successfully implemented parallel agent execution, LLM cost optimization, real-time chat updates, and robust conversation persistence. A major undertaking involved commencing migration to an enterprise-grade, event-driven CI/CD architecture, introducing dual-mode orchestration for Kubernetes and Docker Desktop environments, and integrating advanced observability (Langfuse/Langsmith) and a complex OAuth2 authentication flow for Azure OpenAI. Significant effort was dedicated to debugging Docker-related issues (Makefile syntax, compose file consolidation, frontend build context, yarn.lock, Traefik, MongoDB/Qdrant health). The current state involves refining Docker build processes and finalizing OAuth2 UI, while managing a large-scale architectural overhaul.

<product_requirements>
The Catalyst platform is a multi-agent AI system for full-stack application development. It supports planning, architecting, coding, testing, reviewing, deploying, and exploring, with a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Key features include a conversational UI, LLM integration (Claude, AWS Bedrock, Emergent LLM Key), custom AWS VPC endpoint support, and planned AWS SSO.

Development Phases:
*   **Phase 1-3:** Core agents, GitHub, Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP), monitoring, caching, secret management.
*   **Phase 4 (Implemented):** Context management, cost optimization, learning service (Qdrant), workspace, analytics (Redis, Qdrant, RabbitMQ), Artifactory compatibility.
*   **Recent User Requests:** Context limit, LLM cost-effectiveness, temporary removal of login, chat interface responsiveness, real-time agent feedback in chat, and an overarching migration to an enterprise-grade event-driven architecture (Kafka/NATS, Postgres, S3, OCI registry, preview URLs, GitOps, OPA policies) with dual-mode support for Kubernetes (current environment) and local Docker Desktop. Specific LLM enhancement for Azure OpenAI OAuth2 authentication was also requested.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full migration to the enterprise event-driven architecture, including all agents, event topics, and persistent storage.
-   Further enhance the Explorer agent (Phase 5).
-   Address any remaining Docker build or service health issues reported by the user for their local Docker Desktop environment.
-   Implement the OAuth2 authorization code flow UI completely, allowing users to enter credentials and obtain tokens.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent Docker build issues reported by the user for their local  setup. Specifically, the yarn install v1.22.22

success Already up-to-date.
Done in 0.02s. step in  was hanging due to network issues or  not being found. The AI engineer attempted multiple fixes, including adjusting build context, making  optional, and simplifying the Dockerfile.

Concurrently, the AI engineer was integrating **Organization Azure OpenAI** support into the LLM stack. This involved creating an  for the OAuth2 authorization code flow and  for the specific client. Significant backend modifications were made to  and  to handle the new provider and OAuth2 callback. On the frontend, UI elements for configuring Organization Azure OpenAI and an authentication button for the OAuth2 flow were added to . The final step involved ensuring the UI correctly triggers and handles the OAuth2 authentication process. The build process itself on the user's local machine is currently blocked.
