The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Catalyst multi-agent AI platform, pivoting from a Next.js/NestJS/Postgres stack to React/FastAPI/MongoDB due to platform constraints. The core multi-agent system (Planner, Architect, Coder, Tester, Reviewer, Deployer, Explorer) with a UI for logs and task graphs was established. Key achievements include a full backend conversion from Python to Go and, more recently, integrating LangGraph with a conversational chat interface supporting Claude and AWS Bedrock LLMs. Extensive work has been done on deployment, including Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, and comprehensive Makefiles. The latest efforts focused on debugging persistent Docker build errors related to Artifactory mirror integration and incorrect file path references within Docker configurations, with the engineer actively correcting these pathing issues.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a multi-agent AI platform named Catalyst, mimicking Emergent.sh's architecture for end-to-end application development, encompassing planning, coding, testing, deployment, and an Enterprise Explorer agent to learn and extend internal applications. Initial tech stack preferences included Next.js/React, Node.js/NestJS, and Postgres, with a graph-based orchestration and specific agents. The frontend UI was to feature chat, task graph, project tree, logs, credit meter, and deployment status, ensuring state persistence and deployment reports. The Explorer agent required read-only enterprise tool integration, System Brief generation, and GitHub PR proposals. Due to platform limitations, the stack was adapted to React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The project was further extended with Docker, docker-compose, and Makefile for deployment, a full Python-to-Go backend conversion, and finally, LangGraph integration for a conversational chat interface supporting Claude Code LLM and AWS Bedrock.

<code_architecture>

- : Core FastAPI application. Modified to add chat API endpoints (, ) and corresponding Pydantic models.
- : *New file*. Implements a unified client for LLM interactions (Claude, AWS Bedrock) using  library, supporting both Emergent LLM Key and specific API keys.
- : Orchestrates multi-agent workflows using LangGraph. Updated to utilize , remove deprecated LLM initialization, and fix database logging, emoji, and syntax issues.
- : Handles conversational chat logic. Modified extensively for chat message processing, LangGraph integration, session management,  serialization, and emoji removal.
- : Manages Python dependencies specifically for LangGraph components, now including  and .
- : Updated to include .
- , : New Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations specifically for building with an Artifactory mirror, requiring careful path adjustments to resolve build context errors.
- : Moved from the root directory to  to resolve Docker build context issues encountered with Artifactory builds.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the conversational chat interface's frontend integration.
- Further refine the LangGraph orchestrator if needed by frontend requirements.
- Continue to resolve Docker build errors by correcting file path placements in Dockerfiles and  configurations for Artifactory builds.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work focused on two main areas. Firstly, implementing the LangGraph-based conversational chat interface and multi-LLM support (Claude/Bedrock). This involved creating a unified LLM client (), adding chat API endpoints to , and extensively modifying  and  to integrate LLMs, handle chat logic, and ensure correct data serialization and syntax. This backend work was successfully completed and passed backend tests.

Secondly, significant effort was dedicated to deployment, including generating Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, AWS ECS configurations, and comprehensive Makefiles for various environments. The most recent and ongoing challenge involved resolving persistent Docker build errors (failed to compute cache key, failed to calculate checksum) specifically when attempting to use an Artifactory mirror. These errors were identified as stemming from incorrect build contexts and file path placements within the Dockerfiles and  configurations, where Docker couldn't locate necessary files like , , and . The AI engineer was actively updating Dockerfiles and  files to ensure correct referencing of these files from their actual directory locations.

<optional_next_step>
Continue updating Dockerfiles and  configurations to use correct file paths for Artifactory builds.
