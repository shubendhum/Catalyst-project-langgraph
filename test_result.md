# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: >
  Integrate LangGraph with chat interface and multi-LLM support (Claude/Bedrock).
  User requested both LLM provider choice and API key flexibility (Emergent LLM Key + custom keys).
  Full-featured chat with multi-turn conversations, session management, and agent switching.
  Replace current Dashboard/ProjectView with the new chat interface.

Fixed critical route ordering issue - moved /logs/backend before /logs/{task_id} to prevent path parameter conflict. All 7 Phase 5 tests passed (100% success rate)."

CRITICAL TESTS PASSED: (1) Environment Detection: Correctly identifies kubernetes environment with sequential orchestration mode ✅ (2) Enterprise Features Disabled: Postgres=false, Event Streaming=false, Git=false, Preview Deployments=false ✅ (3) Infrastructure Fallbacks: MongoDB=true, Redis=false (in-memory fallback), Qdrant=false (in-memory fallback) ✅ (4) Backend Health: API root endpoint returns correct version info ✅ (5) Chat Functionality: POST /api/chat/send works without Postgres/RabbitMQ errors, successfully processes messages and returns AI responses ✅ (6) Cost APIs: GET /api/logs/cost-stats returns proper statistics, POST /api/optimizer/select-model recommends optimal models (gpt-4o-mini for simple tasks, 95% savings) ✅ (7) Git Integration: GET /api/git/repos returns empty list with 'Git not enabled in this environment' message ✅ (8) Preview Deployments: GET /api/preview returns empty list with 'Preview deployments not available in this environment' message ✅ (9) Backend Logs: No Postgres or RabbitMQ connection errors, only expected warnings about missing services ✅. CONCLUSION: Enterprise migration has NOT broken the K8s environment. All existing functionality works correctly, new enterprise features are gracefully disabled with proper fallback mechanisms, and the system operates in sequential mode as expected for Kubernetes deployment."

The 'user' directive can only be used when nginx starts as root - in containers, the user is determined at runtime. Ready for Docker build testing. See DOCKER_ENTRYPOINT_FIX.md for complete details."
