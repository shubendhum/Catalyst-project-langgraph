  ```
  - [ ] Network: preview-{task-id} exists

### Access Preview Deployment

- [ ] **Get Preview Details:**
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8001/api/preview | jq
  ```
  - [ ] Returns preview array
  - [ ] Has preview_url
  - [ ] Has fallback_url
  - [ ] Has backend_url
  - [ ] status = "deployed"

  ```bash
  docker exec catalyst-postgres psql -U catalyst -d catalyst_state \
    -c "UPDATE preview_deployments SET expires_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' WHERE status = 'deployed';"
  ```

- [ ] **Trigger Cleanup:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/preview/cleanup-expired
  ```
  - [ ] Response shows count of cleaned up previews

- [ ] **Verify Cleanup Happened:**
  ```bash
  docker ps | grep preview
  ```
  - [ ] No preview containers running

## Event System Verification

### RabbitMQ Event Flow

- [ ] **Build App While Watching RabbitMQ:**
  - [ ] Open: http://localhost:15672
  - [ ] Go to "Queues" tab
  - [ ] In chat: "build a hello world app"
  - [ ] Watch queues:
    - [ ] planner-queue gets message
    - [ ] Message processed (count goes to 0)
    - [ ] architect-queue gets message
    - [ ] Each queue processes in sequence
  
- [ ] **Check Message Details:**
  - [ ] Click on any queue
  - [ ] Click "Get messages"
  - [ ] Should see event payloads with trace_id, task_id, actor

### Postgres Event Audit

- [ ] **View Event Trail:**
  ```bash
  docker exec catalyst-postgres psql -U catalyst -d catalyst_state
  ```
  
  - [ ] Run:
    ```sql
    SELECT actor, event_type, created_at 
    FROM agent_events 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 20;
    ```
  - [ ] Should see events from all agents
  - [ ] Events in order: orchestrator ‚Üí planner ‚Üí architect ‚Üí coder ‚Üí tester ‚Üí reviewer ‚Üí deployer

- [ ] **View Task Progression:**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, status, current_phase, created_at, updated_at
  FROM tasks
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
  - [ ] Task transitions visible: pending ‚Üí planning ‚Üí architecting ‚Üí coding ‚Üí testing ‚Üí reviewing ‚Üí deploying ‚Üí completed

  - [ ] **Expected:** 3-6 minutes total
    - Planning: 30s
    - Architecture: 30s
    - Coding: 60-90s
    - Testing: 30s
    - Review: 30s
    - Deploy: 60-120s (image builds)

### Preview Access Time

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Services Won't Start

- [ ] **Check Docker Desktop:**
  - [ ] Docker Desktop app is running
  - [ ] Adequate resources allocated (Settings ‚Üí Resources)
  - [ ] No other conflicting services using same ports

- [ ] **Check Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.artifactory.yml logs | grep -i error
  ```

- [ ] **Common Issues:**
  - [ ] Port 5432 in use: `lsof -i :5432` (kill or change port)
  - [ ] Port 27017 in use: `lsof -i :27017`
  - [ ] Out of disk space: `docker system df`
  - [ ] Out of memory: Check Docker Desktop resources

### If Postgres Tables Missing

- [ ] **Check Init Script Ran:**
  ```bash
  docker logs catalyst-postgres | grep "Catalyst database initialized"
  ```

- [ ] **Manual Init:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -i catalyst-postgres psql -U catalyst -d catalyst_state < /app/init-db.sql
  ```

### If RabbitMQ Queues Missing

- [ ] **Check Init Script:**
  ```bash
  docker logs catalyst-rabbitmq | grep "initialization complete"
  ```

- [ ] **Manual Init:**
  ```bash
  docker exec catalyst-rabbitmq sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sh
  ```

### If Preview Deployment Fails

- [ ] **Check Docker Socket Access:**
  ```bash
  docker exec catalyst-backend ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
  ```
  - [ ] Should be accessible

- [ ] **Check Backend Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker logs catalyst-backend | grep -i "deploy\|preview"
  ```

- [ ] **Check Available Ports:**
  ```bash
  lsof -i :9000-9999
  ```
  - [ ] Should have free ports in range

### If GitHub Push Fails

- [ ] **Verify Token:**
  ```bash
  docker exec catalyst-backend printenv GITHUB_TOKEN
  ```
  - [ ] Token is set (not empty)

- [ ] **Test Token:**
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
  ```
  - [ ] Returns your user info

- [ ] **Check Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker logs catalyst-backend | grep -i github
  ```
